//Exercise 4: putting together arrays, objects, and d3

//Set up the drawing environment here
var margin = {t:20,r:20,b:20,l:20};
var width = document.getElementById('plot').clientWidth-margin.l-margin.r,
	height = document.getElementById('plot').clientHeight-margin.t-margin.b;


//Run Math.random() n number of times, and check to see where they are distributed
var numOfTrials = 300;

//First, run trials with Math.random() and generate data points as an array

//Then, visualize these data points as circles on a drawing
//What's the x axis?
//What's the y axis?
